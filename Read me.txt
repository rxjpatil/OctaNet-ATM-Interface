# OctaNet ATM Interface

Welcome to the OctaNet ATM Interface project! This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for basic ATM functionalities such as checking bank balance, withdrawing money, and depositing money. It is designed as part of the Python development internship at OctaNet.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.x recommended)
- [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/OctaNet-ATM-Interface.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd OctaNet-ATM-Interface
    ```

3. Open the project in Visual Studio Code:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

4. In VS Code, locate the `ATM.py` file and the `Card_Holder_for_ATM.py` file.

5. Run the `ATM.py` file to start the ATM Interface:

    ```bash
    python ATM.py
    ```
